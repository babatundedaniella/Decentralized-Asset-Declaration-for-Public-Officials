# Decentralized Asset Declaration for Public Officials

This Web3 project leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to create a transparent, tamper-proof system for public officials to declare their assets. It addresses the real-world problem of corruption and lack of accountability by ensuring asset declarations are immutable, publicly verifiable, and resistant to manipulation, while maintaining privacy for sensitive details.

## ✨ Features

🔒 **Immutable Declarations**: Officials submit asset declarations that are permanently recorded on the blockchain.  
📜 **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify the existence and integrity of a declaration without accessing sensitive details.  
🔐 **Controlled Access**: Only authorized auditors (e.g., oversight bodies) can access detailed asset data.  
🕒 **Timestamped Records**: Declarations are timestamped to track changes over time.  
🚫 **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents officials from submitting conflicting or duplicate declarations.  
🔄 **Update Mechanism**: Allows officials to update declarations while preserving historical records.  
📊 **Audit Trails**: Maintains a verifiable history of all declarations and updates for transparency.  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Public Officials**  
- Submit asset declarations (e.g., real estate, financial holdings, business interests) with a hashed summary and encrypted details.  
- Use update functions to amend declarations, with all changes logged immutably.  
- Receive a unique declaration ID for reference.  

**For Verifiers (Public)**  
- Query the blockchain to confirm a declaration exists using its ID or official’s address.  
- Verify the integrity of the hashed summary to ensure no tampering.  

**For Auditors**  
- Access decrypted asset details using authorized keys.  
- Review historical declarations to track changes and detect discrepancies.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Enhances public trust by ensuring transparency and accountability.  
- Reduces corruption risks by making asset declarations tamper-proof.  
- Streamlines audits with secure, blockchain-based access control.  

## 📚 Smart Contracts (6 Total)

1. **AssetDeclarationRegistry**: Manages the registration of new asset declarations.  
2. **AssetHashStorage**: Stores hashed summaries of asset declarations for public verification.  
3. **AccessControl**: Manages permissions for auditors to access sensitive declaration details.  
4. **DeclarationUpdater**: Handles updates to existing declarations while preserving history.  
5. **VerificationContract**: Allows public verification of declaration existence and integrity.  
6. **AuditLog**: Tracks all declaration-related actions (submissions, updates, and access) for auditability.  

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy the Clarity contracts on the Stacks blockchain.  
2. **Register Officials**: Add public officials’ addresses to the AccessControl contract.  
3. **Submit Declarations**: Officials use the AssetDeclarationRegistry to submit hashed and encrypted asset data.  
4. **Verify Declarations**: Public users query the VerificationContract to confirm declarations.  
5. **Audit Process**: Authorized auditors use AccessControl to decrypt and review details.  

## 📜 Example Workflow

1. An official generates a SHA-256 hash of their asset data (e.g., property deeds, bank statements) and encrypts sensitive details.  
2. They call `register-declaration` in the AssetDeclarationRegistry contract, providing the hash, encrypted data, and a timestamp.  
3. The DeclarationUpdater contract logs the declaration ID and links it to the official’s address.  
4. The public can call `verify-declaration` in the VerificationContract to confirm the hash matches the blockchain record.  
5. Auditors with permissions call `access-details` in the AccessControl contract to view decrypted data.  
6. All actions are logged in the AuditLog contract for transparency.  

## 🛠 Technical Details

- **Language**: Clarity (Stacks blockchain).  
- **Security**: Uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) for integrity and encryption for privacy.  
- **Storage**: On-chain for hashes and metadata; off-chain (IPFS/Gaia) for encrypted details.  
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for auditors, enforced by the AccessControl contract.  
- **Scalability**: Optimized for minimal on-chain storage, leveraging Stacks’ microblock architecture.  

## 🛠 Next Steps

- Implement the remaining contracts (AssetHashStorage, AccessControl, etc.) with similar Clarity logic.  
- Integrate with a front-end (e.g., React) for user-friendly declaration submission and verification.  
- Test contracts on the Stacks testnet before mainnet deployment.  
- Collaborate with government bodies to adopt the system for official use.  

## 🌟 Why This Matters

This project promotes transparency in governance, reduces corruption risks, and empowers citizens to hold officials accountable. By leveraging blockchain, it ensures asset declarations are secure, verifiable, and accessible, fostering trust in public institutions.
